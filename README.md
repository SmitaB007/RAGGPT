# RAGGPT
RAGGPT is an advanced chatbot interface that allows users to upload PDF documents (like research papers) and interact conversationally with their content. Powered by LangChain, ChatGroqâ€™s LLM, and HuggingFace Embeddings, this app provides context-aware responses and maintains memory across the chat session using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and session-based history.

# Tech Stack:
Frontend: Streamlit

LLM: Gemma2-9b-It via ChatGroq

Embeddings: all-MiniLM-L6-v2 via HuggingFace

Vector Store: Chroma

PDF Parsing: PyPDFLoader

Memory: ChatMessageHistory

Text Splitting: RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter

# How It Works:
User uploads PDF(s)

PDF content is split into chunks and embedded using HuggingFace embeddings

Chunks are stored in Chroma vector DB

A retriever fetches relevant chunks based on user questions

ChatGroq's Gemma model answers queries using the retrieved context

Conversation history is maintained per session using ChatMessageHistory

# Use Cases:
Research paper analysis

Academic assistant for students

Legal or policy document summarization

PDF knowledge base assistant
